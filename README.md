# HyperTopOga.jl
## Description
**HyperTopOga.jl** (**H**yperelastic **T**opology **O**ptimization using **G**radient-based Methods and **A**utomatic Differentiation) is a topology optimization library that accounts for hyperelastic material models. By applying automatic differentiation to part of the sensitivity analysis, it enables topology optimization regardless of the choice of objective function or hyperelastic model.
This library is based on the following paper:

**Sensitivity analysis of any hyperelastic evaluation functions coupled with adjoint method and automatic differentiation, 2025**. [DOI:10.2139/ssrn.5292866](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5292866)

Please cite this paper when using this library in your research.
